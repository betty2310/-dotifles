천사 같은 "hi" 끝엔 악마 같은 "bye"
매번 미칠듯한 high 뒤엔 뱉어야

이건 답이 없는 test
매번 속더라도 yes
딱한 감정의 노예
얼어 죽을 사랑해

Here I come kick in the door
가장 독한 걸로 줘
뻔하디 뻔한 그 love
더 내놔봐 give me some more
알아서 매달려 벼랑 끝에
한마디면 또 like 헤벌레 해
그 따뜻한 떨림이 새빨간 설렘이
마치 heaven 같겠지만
You might not get in it

Look at me, look at you
누가 더 아플까
You smart 누가 you are
두 눈에 피눈물 흐르게 된다면
So sorry 누가 you are
나 어떡해 나약한 날 견딜 수 없어
애써 두 눈을 가린 채
사랑의 숨통을 끊어야겠어

Let's kill this love!

But you plus me
Sadly can be dangerous

Lucky me, lucky you
결국엔 거짓말 we lie
So what? So what?
만약에 내가 널 지우게
된다면 so sorry
I'm not sorry
나 어떡해 나약한 날 견딜 수 없어
애써 눈물을 감춘 채, eh

After a sweet "hi", there's always a bitter "bye"
After every crazy high, there's a price you have to pay
There's no answer to this test I'll always fall for it yes
I'm a slave to my emotions
Screw this heartless love

Here I come kick in the door
Give me the strongest one
So obvious, that love
Give me more, give me some more
Cling onto the edge of the cliff if you want
With just one word you're like starstruck again
That warm nervous feeling, extreme excitement
Felt like heaven but you might not get in it

Look at me, look at you, who will be in more pain?
You smart like who? You are
If you cry tears of blood from both eyes
So sorry like who? You are
What should I do, I can't stand myself being so weak
While I force myself to cover my eyes
I need to bring an end to this love

Let's kill this love!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Rum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum
Let's kill this love!
Rum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum

Feelin' like a sinner

Thank you baby
I owe it all to you
Got me all messed up
His love is my favorite
But you plus me
Sadly can be dangerous

Lucky me, lucky you
After all, in the end we lie
So what? So what?
If I end up forgetting you
So sorry
I'm not sorry
What should I do? I can't stand myself being so weak
While I force myself to hide my tears
I need to bring an end to this love
